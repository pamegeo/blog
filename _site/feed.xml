        <title>Accounting for methods in data journalism - spreadsheets, scripts and programming notebooks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter is part of the second Data Jouranlism Handbook edited by Jonathan Gray and Liliana Bounegru. The oroginal chapter and rest of the Handbook can be found  &lt;a href=&quot;https://datajournalismhandbook.org/handbook/two/working-with-data/accounting-for-methods-in-data-journalism-spreadsheets-scripts-and-programming-notebooks&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of data journalism, ideas around what can be considered a journalistic source are changing. Sources come in many forms now: public datasets, leaked troves of emails, scanned documents, satellite imagery and sensor data. In tandem with this, new methods for finding stories in these sources are emerging. Machine learning, text analysis and some of the other techniques explored elsewhere in this book are increasingly being deployed in the service of the scoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But data, despite its aura of hard objective truth, can be distorted and mis-represented. There are many ways in which data journalists can introduce error into their interpretation of a dataset and publish a misleading story. There could be issues at the point of data collection which prevent general inferences being made to a broader population. This could, for instance, be a result of a self-selection bias in the way a sample was chosen, something that has become a common problem in the age of internet polls and surveys. Errors can also be introduced at the data processing stage. Data processing or cleaning, can involve geocoding, correcting misspelled names, harmonising categories or excluding certain data points altogether if, for instance, they are considered statistical outliers. A good example of this kind of error at work is the inaccurate geocoding of IP addresses in a widely reported study that purported to show a correlation between political persuasion and consumption of porn&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Then of course we have the meat of the data journalist’s work, analysis. Any number of statistical fallacies may affect this portion of the work such as mistaking correlation with causation or choosing an inappropriate statistic to summarise the dataset in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the ways in which collection, treatment and analysis of data can change a narrative - how does the data journalist reassure the reader that the sources they have used are reliable and that the work done to derive their conclusions is sound?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case that the data journalist is simply reporting the data or research findings of a third-party, they need not deviate from traditional editorial standards adopted by many major news outlets. A reference to the institution that collected and analysed the data is generally sufficient. For example, a recent Financial Times chart on life expectancy in the UK is accompanied by a note which says: “Source: Club Vita calculations based on EuroStat data”. In principle, the reader can then make an assessment of the credibility of the institution quoted. While a responsible journalist will only report studies they believe to be reliable, the third-party institution is largely responsible for accounting for the methods through which it arrived at its conclusions. In an academic context, this will likely include processes of peer review and in the case of scientific publishing it will invariably include some level of methodological transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the increasingly common case where the journalistic organisation produces the data-driven research, then they themselves are accountable to the reader for the reliability of the results they are reporting. Journalists have responded to the challenge of accounting for their methods in different ways. One common approach is to give a description of the general methodology used to arrive at the conclusions within a story. These descriptions should be framed as far as possible in plain, non-technical language so as to be comprehensible to the widest possible audience. A good example of this approach taken by the Guardian and Global Witness in explaining how they count deaths of environmental activists for their &lt;em&gt;Environmental Defenders series&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But – as with all ways of accounting for social life – written accounts have their limits. The most significant issue with them is that they generally do not specify the exact procedures used to produce the analysis or prepare the data. This makes it difficult, or in some cases impossible, to exactly reproduce steps taken by the reporters to reach their conclusions. In other words, a written account is generally not a reproducible one. In the example above, where the data acquisition, processing and analysis steps are relatively straightforward, there may be no additional value in going beyond a general written description. However, when more complicated techniques are employed there may be a strong case for employing reproducible approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;reproducible-data-journalism&quot;&gt;Reproducible data journalism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reproducibility is widely regarded as a pillar of the modern scientific method. It aids in the process of corroborating results and to help identify and address problematic findings or questionable theories. In principle, the same mechanisms can help to weed out erroneous or misleading uses of data in the journalistic context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look at one of the most well-publicised methodological errors in recent academic history can be instructive. In a 2010 paper, Harvard’s Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff purposed to have shown that average real economic growth slows (a 0.1% decline) when a country’s debt rises to more than 90% of gross domestic product (GDP).&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This figure was then used as ammunition by politicians endorsing austerity measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the regression was based on an Excel error. Rather than taking the mean of a whole row of countries, Reinhart and Rogoff had made an error in their formula which meant only 15 out of the 20 countries they looked at were incorporated. Once the all the countries were considered the 0.1% “decline” became a 2.2% average increase in economic growth. The mistake was only picked up when PhD candidate Thomas Herndon and professors Michael Ash and Robert Pollin looked at the original spreadsheet that Reinhard and Rogoff had worked off. This demonstrates the importance of having not just the method written out in plain language - but also having the data and technology used for the analysis itself. But the Reinhart-Rogoff error perhaps points to something else as well - Microsoft Excel, and spreadsheet software in general, may not be the best technology for creating reproducible analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excel hides much of the process of working with data by design. Formulas - which do most of the analytical work in a spreadsheet - are only visible when clicking on a cell. This means that it is harder to review the actual steps taken to reaching a given conclusion. While we will never know for sure, one may imagine that had Reinhart and Rogoff’s analytical work been done in a language in which the steps had to be declared explicitly (e.g. a programming language) the error could have been spotted prior to publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excel based workflows generally encourage the removal of the steps taken to arrive at a conclusion. Values rather than formulas are often copied across to other sheets or columns leaving the “undo” key as the only route back to how a given number was actually generated. “Undo” histories of course are generally erased when an application is closed, and are therefore not a good place for storing important methodological information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-rise-of-the-literate-programmingenvironment-jupyter-notebooks-in-the-newsroom&quot;&gt;The rise of the literate programming environment: Jupyter notebooks in the newsroom&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An emerging approach to methodological transparency is to use so-called “literate programming” environments. Organisations like Buzzfeed, The New York Times and Correctiv are using them to provide human readable documents that can also be executed by a machine in order to reproduce exactly the steps taken in a given analysis.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First articulated by Donald Knuth in the 1980s, literate programming is an approach to writing computer code where the author intersperses code with ordinary human language explaining the steps taken.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The two main literate programming environments in use today are Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Both produce human readable documents that mix plain English, visualisations and code in a single document that can usually be rendered in HTML and published on the web. Original data can be linked to explicitly and any other technical dependencies such as third-party libraries will be clearly identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is there an emphasis on human readable explanation, the code is ordered so as to reflect human logic. Documents written in this paradigm can therefore read like a set of steps in an argument or a series of answers to a set of research questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce each other.”&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of the form is found in Buzzfeed News’ Jupyter Notebook detailing how they analysed trends in California’s wildfires.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Whilst the notebook contains all the code and links to source data required to reproduce the analysis, the thrust of the document is a narrative or conversation with the source data. Explanations are set out under headings that follow a logical line of enquiry. Visualisations and charts are used to bring out key themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect of the “literate” approach to programming is that the documents produced (as Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown files) may be capable of re-assuring even those readers who cannot read the code itself that the steps taken to produce the conclusions are sound. The idea is similar to Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer’s account of “virtual witnessing” as a means of establishing matters of fact in early modern science. Using Robert Boyle’s experimental programme as an example Shapin and Schaffer set out the role that “virtual witnessing” had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The technology of virtual witnessing involves the production in a reader’s mind of such an image of an experimental scene as obviates the necessity for either direct witness or replication. Through virtual witnessing the multiplication of witnesses could be, in principle, unlimited. It was therefore the most powerful technology for constituting matters of fact. The validation of experiments, and the crediting of their outcomes as matters of fact, necessarily entailed their realization in the laboratory of the mind and the mind’s eye. What was required was a technology of trust and assurance that the things had been done and done in the way claimed.”&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documents produced by literate programming environments such as as Jupyter Notebooks - when published alongside articles - may have a similar effect in that they enable the non-programming reader to visualise the steps taken to produce the findings in a particular story. While the non-programming reader may not be able to understand or run the code itself, comments and explanations in the document may be capable of re-assuring them that appropriate steps were taken to mitigate error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for instance a recent Buzzfeed News story on children’s home inspections in the UK.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Jupyter Notebook has specific steps to check that data has been correctly filtered (Figure 1) providing a backstop against the types of simple but serious mistakes that caught Reinhart and Rogoff out. While the exact content of the code may not be comprehensible to the non-technical reader, the presence of these tests and backstops against error with appropriate plain English explanations may go some way to showing that the steps taken to produce the journalist’s findings were sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;more-than-just-reproducibility&quot;&gt;More than just reproducibility&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using literate programming environments for data stories does not just help make them more reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing code can aid collaboration between organisations. In 2016, Global Witness published a web scraper that extracted details on companies and their shareholders from the Papua New Guinea company register.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The initial piece of research aimed to identify the key beneficiaries of the corruption-prone trade in tropical timber which is having a devastating impact on local communities. While Global Witness had no immediate plans to re-use the scraper it developed, the underlying code was published on Github – the popular code sharing website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after, a community advocacy organisation, ACT NOW!, downloaded the code from the scraper, improved it and incorporated it into a their iPNG project that lets members of the public cross-check names of company shareholders and directors against other public interest sources.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The scraper is now part of the core data infrastructure of the site, retrieving data from the Papua New Guinea company registry twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing code within a literate programming environment can also help to streamline certain internal processes where others within an organisation need to understand and check an analysis prior to publication. At Global Witness, Jupyter Notebooks have been used to streamline the legal review process. As notebooks set out the steps taken to a get a certain finding in a logical order, lawyers can then make a more accurate assessment of the legal risks associated with a particular allegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of investigative journalism, one area where this can be particularly important is where assumptions are made around the identity of specific individuals referenced in a dataset. As part of our recent work on the state of corporate transparency in the UK, we wanted to establish which individuals controlled a very large number of companies. This is indicative (although not proof) of them being a so-called “nominee” which in certain contexts - such as when the individual is listed as Person of Significant Control (PSC) - is illegal. When publishing the list of names of those individuals who controlled the most companies, the legal team wanted to know how we knew a specific individual, let’s say John Barry Smith, was the same as another individual named John B. Smith.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A Jupyter Notebook was able to clearly capture how we had performed this type of deduplication by presenting a table at the relevant step that set out the features that were used to assert the identity of individuals (see below).&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These same processes have been used at Global Witness for fact checking purposes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datajournalismhandbook.org/uploads/book_two/accounting-for-methods-in-data-journalism-spreadsheets-scripts-and-programming-notebooks/Image_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2: A section of the Global Witness Jupyter notebook which constructs a table of individuals and accompanying counts based on them having the same first name, surname, month and year of birth and postcode.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A section of the Global Witness Jupyter notebook which constructs a table of individuals and accompanying counts based on them having the same first name, surname, month and year of birth and postcode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jupyter Notebooks have also proven particularly useful at Global Witness when there is need to monitor a specific dataset over time. For instance, in 2018 Global Witness wanted to establish how the corruption risk in the London property market had changed over a two year period.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They acquired a new snapshot of from the land registry of properties owned by foreign companies and re-used and published a notebook we had developed for the same purpose two years previously (Figure 2).&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This yielded comparable results with minimal overhead. The notebook has an additional advantage in this context too: it allowed Global Witness to show its methodology in the absence of being able to re-publish the underlying source data which, at the time of analysis, had certain licensing restrictions. This is something very difficult to do in a spreadsheet-based workflow. Of course, the most effective way of accounting for your method will always be to publish the raw data used. However, journalists often use data that cannot be re-published for reasons of copyright, privacy or source protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While literate programming environments can clearly enhance the accountability and reproducibility of a journalist’s data work, alongside other benefits, there are some important limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such limitation is that to re-produce (rather than just follow or “virtually witness”) an approach set out in a Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown document you need to know how to write, or at least run, code. The relatively nascent state of data journalism means that there is still a fairly small group of journalists, let alone general consumers of journalism, who can code. This means that it is unlikely that the Github repositories of newspapers will receive the same level of scrutiny as say peer reviewed code referenced in an academic journal where larger portions of the community can actually interrogate the code itself. Data journalism may therefore be more prone to hidden errors in code itself when compared to research with a more technically literate audience. As Jeff Harris points out, it probably won’t be long before we see programming corrections published by media outlets in much the same way as traditional that factual errors are published.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is worth noting in this context that tools like Workbench (which is also mentioned in Jonathan Stray’s chapter in this book) are starting to be developed for journalists, which promise to deliver some of the functionality of literate programming environments without the need to write or understand any code&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point it is also worth considering whether the new mechanisms for accountability in journalism may not just be new means through which a pre-existing “public” can scrutinise methods, but indeed play a role in the formation of new types of “publics”. This is a point made by Andrew Barry in his essay, &lt;em&gt;Transparency as a political device&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Transparency implies not just the publication of specific information; it also implies the formation of a society that is in a position to recognize and assess the value of – and if necessary to modify – the information that is made public. The operation of transparency is addressed to local witnesses, yet these witnesses are expected to be properly assembled, and their presence validated. There is thus a circular relation between the constitution of political assemblies and accounts of the oil economy – one brings the other into being. Transparency is not just intended to make information public, but to form a public which is interested in being informed”&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methods elaborated on above for accounting for data journalistic working in themselves may play a role in the emergence of new groups of more technically aware publics that wish to scrutinise and hold reporters to account in ways not previously possible before the advent and use of technologies like literate programming environments in the journalistic context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea speaks to some of Global Witness’s work on data literacy in order to enhance the accountability of the extractives sector. Landmark legislation in the European Union that forces extractives companies to publish project-level payments to governments for oil, gas and mining projects, an area highly vulnerable to corruption, has opened the possibility for far greater scrutiny of where these revenues actually accumulate. However, Global Witness, and other advocacy groups within the Publish What You Pay coalition have long observed that there is no pre-existing “public” which could immediately play this role. As a result, Global Witness and others have developed resources and training programmes to assemble journalists and civil society groups in resource rich countries who can be supported in developing the skills to use this data to more readily hold companies to accounts. One component to this effort has been the development and publication of specific methodologies for red flagging suspicious payment reports that could be corrupt.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literate programming environments are currently a promising means through which data journalists are making their methodologies more transparent and accountable. While data will always remain open to multiple interpretations, technologies that make a reporter’s assumptions explicit and their methods reproducible are valuable. They aid collaboration and open up an increasingly technical discipline to scrutiny from various publics. Given the current crisis of trust in journalism, a wider embrace of reproducible approaches may be one important way in which data teams can maintain their credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How can we use artificial intelligience to help us fight corruption in the mining sector?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Minerals underpin our daily lives, from the cars and smartphones that we use to the infrastructure and architecture that surrounds us. They have driven the economic development of many countries and could drive that of many more. Yet, often mined and traded in insecure, poverty-stricken and unregulated areas, they may instead enrich an unscrupulous few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting access to reliable data on mineral extraction and trade is challenging. This can be down to issues of physical access (for example in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/myanmar/&quot;&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/democratic-republic-congo/&quot;&gt;DRC&lt;/a&gt;), an unwillingness on the part of companies and governments to be more transparent or a lack of technical capacity of providers. This lack of information makes investigating business practices and exposing wrongdoing more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-importance-of-satellite-imagery&quot;&gt;The importance of satellite imagery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where satellite imagery comes in. Data generated from satellites, and, in some cases drones, could provide citizens, researchers and journalists unprecedented access to surface markers of mining activity. This data could be used to verify official statistics and flag discrepancies, or as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(statistics)&quot;&gt;proxies&lt;/a&gt; where no other statistics exist, and thus be an important tool for holding the mining sector to account&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If used responsibly, companies could also employ satellite imagery to help identify risks in their supply chains (such as discrepancies between the location of mines and export statistics to look out for cross-border smuggling) and governments to monitor otherwise hard to access regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at Global Witness we’ve manually reviewed high-resolution satellite imagery to get the investigative insights we need, for example when looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/afghanistan/talc-everyday-mineral-funding-afghan-insurgents/&quot;&gt;ISIS talc mining in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and logging in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/forests/stained-trade/&quot;&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;. But this often requires advance knowledge of what you are looking for and, perhaps more importantly, a lot of time – practical when the area is small, but less so over a larger region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-role-of-artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;The role of artificial intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://site-media.globalwitness.org/images/Picture1_oiXXjRq.width-600.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eastern DRC’s dense forests and tropical cloud cover could have hampered the resolution of the Landsat satellite imagery. Cloudy Landsat 8 satellite image overlaid on a high resolution map. Paradiso Mine (an artisanal gold mining site), Ituri Province.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning may provide a solution to the challenges of using satellite imagery. Computer algorithms can now be trained to look for specific markers in images that are either too subtle for a human to identify or would take too long for them to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other domains, these approaches are already improving our lives. Scientists have developed programmes that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/84fcc16c-0787-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5&quot;&gt;better at detecting disease in retinal scans than doctors&lt;/a&gt;, and publicly available satellite imagery is already being used by environmental watchdogs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://glad.umd.edu/projects/global-forest-watch&quot;&gt;detect and estimate forest cover loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year Global Witness joined &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datakind.org/&quot;&gt;DataKind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://resourcegovernance.org/&quot;&gt;NRGI&lt;/a&gt; to explore the feasibility of using satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to automatically detect certain types of mining activity across a large area. To our knowledge this kind of project has never successfully been done before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out to build a computer programme capable of automatically identifying the location of mines using satellite imagery. For this first attempt, we focussed on small-scale mining in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo – for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small mines are harder to find than larger industrial ones, which have more obvious and extensive markers. If we could do it with small mines, we knew we could also easily use the model/data to identify larger ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had “training data” readily available for this region and type of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;training-the-model&quot;&gt;Training the model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to build the model we used a technique called machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence and has a variety of applications in everyday life, from Google Translate to email spam filtering. In statistical terms, we were seeking to predict the location of mine sites. This meant assigning a probability that a given pixel of a piece of satellite imagery was in fact part of a mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we needed was satellite imagery and lots of it. We needed it to be quickly accessible to the software we were going to build and we needed it to be free. Amazingly, a service called &lt;a href=&quot;https://earthengine.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Earth Engine&lt;/a&gt; now makes historical data from the Landsat satellite available in the cloud for just this purpose. The Landsat passes over the same places on Earth every sixteen days. It’s an extraordinarily powerful tool allowing you to analyse dynamic changes in the landscape and environment that could be indicative of mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we needed a “training” dataset with the real location of some known artisanal mines. The algorithm could then “learn” what a mine pixel looks like and more accurately predict where other mines exist. Finding a training dataset of artisanal mines in eastern DRC could have been tough, but we were lucky to have access to data collected by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipisresearch.be/&quot;&gt;International Peace Information Service (IPIS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team of volunteer data scientists then built an application to outline each of the mines identified by IPIS, effectively drawing shapes around their boundaries (see below image).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://site-media.globalwitness.org/images/image8.width-600.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of outlines of the manually drawn IPIS mine sites that were used to train the model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shapes – which represented known mine sites – could then be fed into our machine learning algorithm to train the model. The volunteers found that so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest&quot;&gt;“random forest” algorithms&lt;/a&gt; (nothing to do with actual forests!) were the most effective at predicting mine sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model’s effectiveness was evaluated by seeing how many of the known (but “unseen”) mine sites from the IPIS dataset it was capable of accurately identifying whilst only being trained on a partial portion of the data. The idea being that the better it could identify these mine sites, the better it would be able to identify entirely new or previously unidentified mine sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were promising. The best model could identify 79.7% of the known mines. The downside – and where more work is required – is that the model had a high false positive rate. This meant that it often identified pixels as mines where no mining activity was present. Of all the pixels that were not part of known mine sites, the model could only identify 48.4% of them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://site-media.globalwitness.org/images/Picture1_xwfkDwP.width-600.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data pipeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A diagram of the data processing workflow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the model needs some refinement, it has clearly shown that this is a fruitful avenue for further research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all technology, it has its limitations and could be captured for private or commercial advantage, or be misused, and thus help perpetuate certain current, irresponsible trading models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate these risks, we believe that open source development – the process of making computer code and its outputs freely available to all – is a critical exercise for accountability organisations like ours. It creates information infrastructures that serve the public interest and produce knowledge that can be used by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative is that technological innovation takes place within proprietary walled gardens. Proprietary systems can reinforce the information asymmetries where certain powerful actors – whether governments, companies or individuals – supress information, which they themselves use to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataKind have open sourced all the code produced and we hope that this can kickstart innovation for social good in this area. For developers, civic hackers and academics interested in building on the model we created, the source code is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/datakind/public-DKHQ_GlobalWitness&quot;&gt;Github here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How we mined the world's first open data register of company control</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week we published the findings from our in-depth analysis of the world’s first open register of who controls companies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/anonymous-company-owners/companies-we-keep/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Companies We Keep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that two-years on the UK register of beneficial owners is having an important impact. One good example of this is the drop in rate of incorporation of one of the UK’s most widely abused corporate entities for money laundering, Scottish Limited Partnerships (SLPs). SLPs have been implicated in numerous money laundering scandals, and following their inclusion in the beneficial ownership regime in 2017, their rate of incorporation plummeted (see chart below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-a4Ok1&quot; src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a4Ok1/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;&quot; height=&quot;472&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, our analysis also revealed that serious loopholes remain in the register and that could be exploited by individuals intent on keeping their association with companies hidden. The government and Companies House urgently need to address these issues if the register is to fulfill its potential. See more of our recommendations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/anonymous-company-owners/companies-we-keep/#chapter-4/section-0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New data, new challenges, new ways of working&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was a first for Global Witness. We collaborated with volunteer data scientists from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-uk&quot;&gt;DataKind UK&lt;/a&gt; who helped us mine the register and find answers to key investigative and research questions. We took these insights to Companies House and used them to make the case for what needed to be improved for the register to fulfill its potential. This collaborative approach was really effective, and Companies House has already implemented some of our earlier recommendations and is now considering ways to implement the red flagging systems we developed. It is fitting recognition of the brilliant work of the team of volunteers that the project is also now a finalist for the 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datsciawards.ie/awards/best-data-science-social-impact/&quot;&gt;DatSci Social Impact award&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three challenges we faced when we confronted the project: scale, reproducibility and the networked nature of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of data, not enough memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the data was very large. With over 10 million records on companies, officers and beneficial owners, it far exceeded what a normal laptop can handle. We needed to use powerful cloud-based computers in order to store, clean and analyse the data. There is a mind-boggling array of relatively low cost options for cloud computing today. We chose to use a virtual machine on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with 122 GB of memory. This is is about 30 times more powerful than the average laptop with 4GB of RAM. These servers cost about $1 an hour to run on a pay-as-you-go basis. We would start them when performing computationally expensive tasks where we were required to handle all the data at once in memory and then just stop them at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproducibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we wanted to share our working with Companies House and other anti-corruption watchdogs keen who were also keen to monitor the data. We did this by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/the-companies-we-keep&quot;&gt;publishing all the code we wrote&lt;/a&gt; to extract, process, clean and analyse the various datasets we used. This would enable anyone else to reproduce our working and build on top of it. If you’re interested in doing this, please fork &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/the-companies-we-keep&quot;&gt;our code&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having our analysis as reproducible computer scripts also has the advantage that we can re-run our analysis and monitor the data at a later date and compare our results. This will be an important way through which we can understand if some of the issues we identified get resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything is a network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://site-media.globalwitness.org/images/Untitled-1.width-500.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we wanted not just to count records of specific types, but identify patterns. For instance, we wanted to be able to identify which companies controlled themselves via other companies or which companies were part of very complicated ownership structures. We addressed this by using so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-db-vs-rdbms/&quot;&gt;‘graph’ database technology&lt;/a&gt;. Graph database technology helps researchers that want to understand connections in networks. We used two tools - &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkurio.us/&quot;&gt;Linkurious&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://neo4j.com/&quot;&gt;Neo4J&lt;/a&gt; - that are becoming popular amongst tech savvy investigative journalists such as ICIJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the collaboration with DataKind worked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage of collaboration with DataKind began with a two-day event in November 2016, almost six months after the launch of the UK register. The event, organised in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencorporates.com/&quot;&gt;OpenCorporates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spendnetwork.com/&quot;&gt;Spend Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://occrp.org/&quot;&gt;OCCRP&lt;/a&gt;, was used to develop an exploratory analysis of the register.The insights and investigative leads generated that day were passed onto Companies House, which has since made changes to the register’s nationality field and age prompts, and looked further into 2,500 companies linked to secrecy jurisdictions. In 2017, the second stage of collaboration with DataKind began, involving a dedicated team of four volunteer data scientists working alongside Global Witness and culminating in the briefing published last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civic tech and the importance of open source for collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Global Witness we want to embrace the open ethos of some of the most exciting investigative journalism in the last few years. Historically journalists have not been the most collaborative types, but investigative data journalism seems to be bucking this trend. Increasing numbers of media outlets are not only publishing the data that underpins their scoops but they are also publishing the source code that can help others to check, tweak and reuse their work in new scenarios. A growing list of open journalism initiatives is &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpocket.com/a/read/2057846274&quot;&gt;curated here&lt;/a&gt; and includes contributions from the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ajam&quot;&gt;AlJazeera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NYTimes&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Global Witness we’ve seen the value of sharing the technology you build first hand. Computer programs we developed to extract data from the Papua New Guinea register have been re-used and improved as part of an ambitious transparency initiative called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pngiportal.org/&quot;&gt;PNGi&lt;/a&gt; which let’s users search and explore the connections between companies and political institutions. A similar story can be told about other open source investigative tech, such as Aleph which power &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.occrp.org/&quot;&gt;data.occrp.org&lt;/a&gt; and is also used by extractives industry watchdog group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://aleph.openoil.net/&quot;&gt;OpenOil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open data and the many eyes of the crowd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we show in &lt;em&gt;The Companies We Keep&lt;/em&gt;, it is essential that beneficial ownership data is published in an open format. While our report exposes issues with the UK’s register around verification and validation, we know that it is always riskier to lie in public than in secret. We also know that without the data being made available in an open format many of issues with the register that we identified would have remained hidden. On this project we’ve applied much the same principle to our working. We have published our source code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/the-companies-we-keep&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; for others to review and build on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Joining the dots - From property deals at the Trump Ocean Club, Panama to Latin American drug cartels</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In October Global Witness’ investigation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club, Panama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exposed how profits from Colombian cartels were trafficked through the purchase of real estate units at a Panama property development which Donald Trump made millions selling his name to. The investigation was based on months of research, interviews and in-depth data work on public sources including the Panamanian Company Registry, the Panamanian Land Registry and OpenCorporates.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post describes in broad brush strokes some of the steps we took in the data research for &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt;. It outlines how we built programmes that took raw data from OpenCorporates.com and turned it into something that the broader investigative team could visually explore, verify and then incorporate into their final story. The scripts could be re-run quickly whenever the underlying data was changed, for example, when new companies of interest were identified as having been involved in purchasing property. The approaches outlined here are becoming increasingly central to how organisations like ours collaborate around digital sources and data to expose corruption more effectively in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automating-searches-for-relevant-companies-using-opencorporates&quot;&gt;Automating searches for relevant companies using OpenCorporates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using scripts that automatically queried OpenCorporates we were able to incorporate much larger sets of information in our research than would be allowed by manual extraction. OpenCorporates is the world’s largest open database of company information; it contains the records on over 138 million companies registered in a huge range of jurisdictions. As well as offering web-based search it also offers a number of tools to data journalists via its &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.opencorporates.com/&quot;&gt;Application Programming Interface (API)&lt;/a&gt; to help them find, extract and connect large numbers of companies in automated workflows. In some cases this can substantially reduce the amount of time required to do investigative tasks. For instance, extracting all the companies a given individual is a director of can be automated via writing a simple computer script. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt; we used this to identify companies that had been created apparently in order to purchase properties at Trump Ocean Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-network-analysis-tools---neo4j-and-linkurious---to-reveal-patterns-in-the-data&quot;&gt;Using network analysis tools - Neo4J and Linkurious - to reveal patterns in the data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used a visualisation tool called Linkurious that enables us to share and spot patterns that would otherwise be difficult to detect if just looking at tables and statistics. As is the case in many Global Witness investigations, our core dataset on &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt; was made of properties, people and companies that represented a complicated real world network. This network had certain features that were of interest to our researchers. For example, we wanted to know which people directed the most property-purchasing companies and who else the companies were connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to find this out and explore the connections in our data we used a database tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://neo4j.com/&quot;&gt;Neo4J&lt;/a&gt; and an exploration technology, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkurio.us/&quot;&gt;Linkurious&lt;/a&gt;. This tool stack was also used by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists to interrogate the data contained within both the Panama and Paradise Papers and now powers their &lt;a href=&quot;https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/&quot;&gt;Offshore Leaks site&lt;/a&gt;. While the dataset for &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt; was much smaller than either of these gigantic leaks, these tools helped us to do three things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it enabled us to quantify and see how individuals of interest, such as Alexandre Ventura Nogueira, were connected to companies apparently used to purchase properties at the Trump Ocean Club, Panama:. Second, it allowed us to gain a different perspective on our data. Data visualisation has long been understood in statistics as not simply about generating pretty insights, but also integral to the process of data exploration (for those who haven’t seen it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet&quot;&gt;Anscombe’s quartet&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful illustration of this). Third, it allowed us to provide an interactive snapshot of some limited portions of our data when we published the report online:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://linkurious.globalwitness.org/widget/8bb8e819&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interactive above illustrates the networks we found using OpenCorporates and network analysis tool, Linkurious. It shows some of the directors, officers, agents, and subscribers of 7 Homes companies discussed in our investigation Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club, Panama. Click on the companies to find out more information about them. Company and officer data was extracted from OpenCorporates and verified in the original Panamanian company registry. Read the full report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis is reproducible if you can reach the same conclusions or make the same inferences based on the same data. The importance of reproducibility to the development of modern science has been understood for at least three centuries. It is the means through which the conclusion of one person or group can be tested and interrogated by others. As more journalism becomes dependent on data sources, the tools used for doing reproducible analysis in the sciences have started to be applied to investigations. These tools help data journalists and the teams they are working with move from the raw data to their conclusions, documenting each step on the way. For those wanting a good explanation of the key components to a reproducible analysis that can be shared with others, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing&quot;&gt;see Jeff Leek&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt; all our analysis was written in the easy-to-learn programming language Python and stored as a reproducible script in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt;. This had three key advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the underlying data was changed (for instance we identified new companies that had been set up with the apparent intention of being used to purchase Trump Ocean Club properties) the analysis could be re-run at the click of a button. This saved us time and reduced the possibility of introducing error by re-doing the analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every step that we took extracting, cleaning and analysing the data was written out in plain non-technical English so that we developed a record of each assumption we made. This meant that lawyers, researchers and investigators could understand and agree on the chosen approach. Having the analysis organised and stored in this fashion is also very helpful later down the line when revisiting an analysis that was undertaken previously. Anyone who has undertaken complicated data transformation and analysis using Excel will know how easy it is to lose track of the steps taken to arrive at your final analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jupyter Notebooks can easily be shared within a team and published online in conjunction with a story. This enables others to rerun your analysis and understand the exact steps you took to reach your conclusions. Code sharing sites like Github now render them and any visuals so that they no longer require specialist software to view. You can see our recent analysis of property owned by offshore companies in England and Wales in the form of a Jupyter Notebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/overseas_companies_land_ownership/blob/master/overseas_companies_land_ownership_analysis.ipynb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The 86,000 secretly owned properties in England and Wales</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/two-years-still-dark-about-86000-anonymously-owned-uk-homes/&quot;&gt;originally published on the Global Witness blog&lt;/a&gt; and was co-written with my colleague Naomi Hirst.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 David Cameron issued a threat to the corrupt, declaring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-new-global-commitments-to-expose-punish-and-drive-out-corruption&quot;&gt;‘London is not a place to stash your dodgy cash’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to stop dirty money from being funnelled into the country through anonymously owned companies his Government promised to create a public register naming the real owners of all overseas companies that own UK properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, despite making the commitment again in front of over 40 governments at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-new-global-commitments-to-expose-punish-and-drive-out-corruption&quot;&gt;International Anti-Corruption Summit&lt;/a&gt; just last year, and in the face of widespread domestic support for making the UK property market more transparent, progress has stalled. We’re two years on and the register is nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe the British government know better than us? Maybe after the tough talk at the Summit all the secret beneficiaries left the shadows and incorporated companies in plain sight. It’s possible, right…?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out whether or not we were barking up the wrong tree, we joined forces with friends at Who Owns England? and Transparency International UK to look at the most recent Land Registry data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, our analysis found that since the property register was promised, nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still in the dark about the 86,000+ UK properties that are owned by anonymous companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As initially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-average-estate-agents-commission-on-a-1m-sale-is-20-000-the-average-fine-for-money-laundering-breaches-is-1-134-sjc5hch05&quot;&gt;published in The Times&lt;/a&gt;, our joint analysis found that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secret ownership of property in England and Wales remains virtually unchanged since 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The total number of properties owned by companies incorporated in secrecy jurisdictions remains virtually unchanged from late 2015, at &lt;strong&gt;86,000&lt;/strong&gt; - suggesting the Government’s rhetoric has had little effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As was the case in 2015, &lt;strong&gt;87%&lt;/strong&gt; of all properties owned by overseas companies have an owner in jurisdictions which keep information about the real people behind the company secret.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tens of thousands of properties are owned through companies incorporated in the highly secretive British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;57,000 properties are owned by companies registered in British Overseas Territories &amp;amp; Crown Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt; - including places like the British Virgin Islands, Jersey, and the Isle of Man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the most expensive UK property sales in recent years have been made via companies incorporated in secrecy jurisdictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the Land Registry, the most expensive property owned by a company based in secrecy jurisdiction is 123 Buckingham Palace Road which is worth &lt;strong&gt;£215,399,999&lt;/strong&gt; and owned by a Jersey-based company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top 10 most expensive properties owned by companies in secrecy jurisdictions are worth over £1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The use of companies incorporated in secrecy jurisdictions to purchase property is increasing in some areas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2015 the London borough of &lt;strong&gt;Tower Hamlets has seen an 11% increase&lt;/strong&gt; in the number of properties owned by companies incorporated by secrecy jurisdictions, meanwhile &lt;strong&gt;Greater Manchester has experienced a 10% increase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secret ownership of property remains especially high in the London boroughs of Kensington &amp;amp; Chelsea and the City of Westminster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;City of Westminster over 10,000 properties&lt;/strong&gt; are owned anonymously whilst in the &lt;strong&gt;Royal Borough of Kensington &amp;amp; Chelsea the tally almost 6,000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;max-width:900px&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rOQBW/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;602&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new findings tell us that the need for a property register remains as strong as ever. And as we approach International Anti-Corruption Day, all eyes are on Margot James as Minister for Corporate Responsibility to fulfil the commitment the Government made to citizens and to leaders from around the world to get dirty money out of the UK property market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproduce our analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those wanting to reproduce our analysis, expand upon it or understand more about our approach, the code is available as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/overseas_companies_land_ownership/blob/master/overseas_companies_land_ownership_analysis.ipynb&quot;&gt;Jupyter notebook via Github&lt;/a&gt;. The Land Registry data (accurate as of October 2017) that we used for this analysis has now been published freely, but you will still need to go through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-overseas-companies-ownership-data&quot;&gt;steps to download it&lt;/a&gt; in order to reproduce our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These findings are based on the Land Registry’s Overseas Ownership Dataset as initially received and processed by Global Witness. This dataset is now available free of charge at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-overseas-companies-ownership-data&quot;&gt;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-overseas-companies-ownership-data  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Secrecy jurisdiction” is a term used as an alternative to the more widely used term tax havens. These jurisdictions use secrecy to attract illicit and illegitimate or abusive financial flows. This analysis deems any jurisdiction with a “financial secrecy score” of 60 and above in the Tax Justice Network’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results&quot;&gt;Financial Secrecy Index&lt;/a&gt; to be a secrecy jurisdiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Top 6 workshops from NICAR 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to attend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ire.org/nicar/&quot;&gt;NICAR&lt;/a&gt; this year - the largest gathering of data journalists worldwide and all-round geek fest. A mind-boggling array of workshops and events were on offer covering the broad range of techniques used by journalists to investigate and present topics using data. These were my top 5 sessions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robroc/GIS-with-python&quot;&gt;top 5 Python libraries for working with geospatial data&lt;/a&gt; - A whirlwind tour from Roberto Rocha of the 5 best libraries for building a powerful but efficient workflows for analysing, wrangling and presenting geospatial data. It included easy starter code snippets wrapped up in a single Jupyter/notebook presentation to boot. &lt;a href=&quot;http://geopandas.org/&quot;&gt;Geopandas&lt;/a&gt; is already proving an invaluable tool in my day-to-day. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robroc/GIS-with-python&quot;&gt;https://github.com/robroc/GIS-with-python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Michelle Borkin’s talk on the cognition of data visualisation based on a large scale experiment which tracked the responses, recall and eye-movements of volunteers exposed to hundreds of static infographics and charts. Some of the findings were surprising and counter to the lauded Tufte’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php/Data-Ink_Ratio&quot;&gt;data-ink ratio paradigm&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, Borkin found that information redundnacy in charts positively influenced particiapnts’ recall and understanding. The whole dataset for the project including has been released for openly as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://massvis.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Massvis Dataset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A quick introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://flourish.studio/&quot;&gt;Kiln’s Flourish Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Kiln founder Duncan Clarke demoed the new platform for publishing interactive data visualisations that combines re-usability, clean GUI interfaces for data updating whilst allowing for radical creativity in the design process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buzzfeed’s Open Labs Fellows’ crash course in mining data from social media sources including Facebook and Twitter with a handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buzzfeed-openlab/big-picture/wiki/Guide:-Harvesting-social-data&quot;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt; of scripts to get you started on coding up your own scrapers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buzzfeed-openlab/big-picture/wiki/Guide:-Harvesting-social-data&quot;&gt;https://github.com/buzzfeed-openlab/big-picture/wiki/Guide:-Harvesting-social-data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meredith Broussard (New York University) and William Lyon (Neo4J) demonstrated how the network database Neo4J can be used to explore campaign finance. ICIJ have showed through the Panama Papers the power of Neo4J for investigating and presenting complex networks. Neo4J now runs a journalism accelerator programme to encourage uptake by newsrooms. More info &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/neo4j_ddj&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neil Halloran - the creator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/128373915&quot;&gt;Fallen of World War II&lt;/a&gt; - gave wide-ranging talk on the natural tension between statistics and sentiment and how we can do a better job at marrying gate two. Including some great links to further reading that I will follow up on: Steven Pinker’s &lt;em&gt;The Better Angels of Our Nature&lt;/em&gt; and Daniel Kahneman’s &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast &amp;amp; Slow&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s a link to the amazing visual data story if you haven’t seen it already:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/128373915&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrys Wu has helpfully pulled together the various tip sheets and slide decks from some of the other sessions: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.chryswu.com/2017/03/02/nicar17-slides-links-tutorials-nicar17/&quot;&gt;http://blog.chryswu.com/2017/03/02/nicar17-slides-links-tutorials-nicar17/&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in getting involved there is a very active disucssion list &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ire.org/resource-center/listservs/subscribe-nicar-l/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive thanks to all the organisers and stalwarts of the Nicar community for facilitating such a brilliant exchange of stories, skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why we published the data behind Hostile Takeover</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post was originally posted on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/why-we-published-data-behind-hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;Global Witness website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will come as no shock to Cambodians that their ruling elite has amassed vast fortunes whilst in power. As our report, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/reports/hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, shows, members of Prime Minister Hun Sen’s family have business interests spanning the majority of the country’s major industries. While 40% of Cambodians live below or close to the poverty line, the Hun family have a combined wealth estimated to total between US$ 500 million and US$ 1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But until fairly recently it has been extremely difficult for activists and campaigners to prove this with hard facts and solid data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has enabled the country’s most powerful family to continue to line its pockets behind a wall of secrecy. It has also allowed international companies and investors to establish business relationships with members of Hun Sen’s family, either unaware of or unconcerned by previous allegations of corruption and human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations-of-the-original-dataset&quot;&gt;Limitations of the original dataset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication of data by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moc.gov.kh/en-us/&quot;&gt;Cambodia’s Ministry of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; was a step towards greater transparency. The data held the key to the extensive business interests of Cambodia’s ruling elite, exposing just how much of a grip Hun Sen and his family have over the nation’s economy. However, in its original form the data was unusable for investigative purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we commend the Ministry of Commerce for publishing the data in the first place, the information provided suffered from a number of issues that prevented our researchers from using it effectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The database was put behind a login, making it difficult to programmatically access&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search portal didn’t allow people to download the dataset in its entirety&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The service and availability of information changed from time to time. This posed a risk to our research that data would be taken offline or modified without our knowledge. Since the publication of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/reports/hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report - for instance - shareholder information has been removed completely&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry’s servers were slow and unreliable, making it difficult to conduct in-depth research&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these limitations we extracted the contents of the database and developed our own version with the functionality needed to support in-depth investigation. This is known as “web scraping” by techies, and it is becoming an essential process in a wide-range of investigations at Global Witness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-data-and-network-effects&quot;&gt;Open data and network effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Global Witness we passionately believe that our investigations should be a platform for change. We are well aware, however, that the kinds of changes we want to see can only be achieved when we work through networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to data and technology this means enabling a range of actors - from civil society groups to law enforcement - to use the databases we’ve built up and the technology we’ve developed to verify our findings and spot things we haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what we did for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/reports/hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We have published both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;dataset that we extracted&lt;/a&gt; from the Ministry of Commerce in its entirety and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;the research tool&lt;/a&gt; we developed to interrogate this information including the underlying &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/cambodia-corporates&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;. We have applied &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendefinition.org/&quot;&gt;open licenses&lt;/a&gt; to all of these so anyone can freely access, remix and build on our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodian newspaper &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phnompenhpost.com/&quot;&gt;The Phnom Penh Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; made great use of the data almost immediately after we launched our report. As well as publishing their own analysis of the data we provided, they also produced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/inside-hun-familys-business-empire#interactive&quot;&gt;playful interactive&lt;/a&gt; letting readers explore the wide-ranging business interests of the Hun Sen family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/inside-hun-familys-business-empire&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/media/images/Screen_Shot_2016-08-19_at_10.17.02.width-500.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cambodia Wheel of Fortune&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By publishing our data openly we also want it to be re-used in some of the game-changing aggregation and search services being built by civic-hackers and tech-for-good enterprises like &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencorporates.com/&quot;&gt;OpenCorporates&lt;/a&gt;. Powerful, free tools for investigative journalists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.occrp.org/&quot;&gt;data.occrp.org&lt;/a&gt; benefit hugely from organisations choosing to open their data post-publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools and this pooling of information is ever more important for anti-corruption campaigners who - in their attempts to unravel global illicit financial flows - need to be able to join the dots between fragmented and siloed datasets. In the same way that medical researchers across the world leverage the technology, data and methods of their peers to defeat deadly diseases, the fight against corruption could benefit from a far more joined up investigative community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But openness isn’t just a practical matter for us, it’s also a principle. As an organisation that asks governments and companies around the world to do more of their work in the open where it can be scrutinised by the public, we believe that once we’ve published a story, and where no risks exist for our sources, we should publish the data we’ve collected as permissibly as possible. We invite others to verify our findings and scrutinise our methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being able to conduct searches for companies and directors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;Cambodia Corporates&lt;/a&gt; has a number of functions not available on the original site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fuzzy search for names - It’s a common problem in many datasets that names for the same person are spelt differently on different records. This is particularly problematic in cases where names have been. transliterated from Roman script. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;Cambodia Corporates&lt;/a&gt; let’s you introduce “fuzziness” into your search by choosing the number of characters that the results can vary from your original search term&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the nationality of chairpersons - The Ministry of Commerce website doesn’t allow you to look at the nationality of the chairperson of Cambodian registered companies. This is important information for understanding international investment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download all the data - There are many colleagues and researchers out there who will want to do things with the information that we haven’t anticipated. Perhaps they will want to combine it with other databases they are building. We also want to enable those building excellent registries and search tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencorporates.com&quot;&gt;OpenCorproates&lt;/a&gt; and OCCRP (&lt;a href=&quot;http://data.occrp.org&quot;&gt;data.occrp.org&lt;/a&gt;) to connect to this information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/cambodia-corporates&quot;&gt;Get the source code&lt;/a&gt; - For the geeks amongst you, you can download, tweak and re-deploy our source code for similar projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Following the publication of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/reports/hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the Ministry of Commerce database no longer contains the shareholder data that our investigation was built on. The reasons as to why this data is no longer available are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/government-scrubs-database-exposed-hun-family-riches-116772/&quot;&gt;unclear&lt;/a&gt;. This important information is currently only available from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;Cambodia Corporates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access the fully functional research tool and the attached database of companies and directors at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorproates.globalwitness.org&quot;&gt;https://cambodiacorproates.globalwitness.org&lt;/a&gt;, the underlying source code is available on GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/cambodia-corporates&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A quick look at offshore property ownership in England &amp; Wales</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The ownership of properties and land in England and Wales by companies registered in overseas countries has come under significant scrutiny in recent months. Reports by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/mystery-baker-street/&quot;&gt;Global Witness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8340483/A-look-round-the-London-house-thought-to-be-owned-by-Libyas-Saif-al-Islam-Gaddafi.html&quot;&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/04/uk-properties-held-by-offshore-firms-used-in-global-corruption-say-police&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.private-eye.co.uk/registry&quot;&gt;Private Eye&lt;/a&gt; have shown that offshore ownership can be a convenient means to launder the proceeds of crime and corruption. As it turns out, it is also a convenient mechanism to avoid tax assocaited with buying and selling a property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saplaw.co.uk/uk-legal-services/commercial-lawyers-london/commercial-lawyers-articles/using-an-offshore-company-to-buy-and-sell-uk-residential-property&quot;&gt;telling article&lt;/a&gt; on the website of a UK based solicitors lists the potential “tax advantages” of this approach to trading UK property. I quote directly from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saplaw.co.uk/uk-legal-services/commercial-lawyers-london/commercial-lawyers-articles/using-an-offshore-company-to-buy-and-sell-uk-residential-property&quot;&gt;the site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Regardless of who owns the property any rental income will remain taxable in the UK. If the property is owned by an offshore company only the basic rate of UK income tax (20%) will apply regardless of the level of income.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“A property can be sold by selling the shares in the company with no UK Capital Gains Tax.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“If the property is in the name of an individual then on their death inheritance tax is potentially payable on the net value of the property.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“No stamp duty land tax is payable by a buyer of the shares in the company.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that we’re in the midst of a housing crisis, and with tenants in London paying on average &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/16/tenants-in-england-spend-half-their-pay-on-rent&quot;&gt;72% of their gross income&lt;/a&gt;, the fact that so much property is not subject to normal UK tax law seems particualrly unjust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/land-registry-overseas-companies-data&quot;&gt;data published by the Land Registry in March 2016&lt;/a&gt;. It contains information on all freeholds and leasholds owned by companies registered overseas. The data is accurate as of 31st October 2015. It contains almost 100,000 leaseholds addresses and includes information on tenure, date of purchase, price paid and if there are multiple owners. This data was made available in response to increasing pressue from civil society groups for greater transparency in the property market and some well-publicised &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.private-eye.co.uk/registry&quot;&gt;Freedom of Information requests concerning the extent of offshore ownership of land and property in England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;little-data-available-on-price-but-as-an-estimate&quot;&gt;Little data available on price, but as an estimate…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know from this information that at least £10.1 billion of land and property is owned by overseas company. Considering that only 7% of these properties contains price paid data, that’s a staggering figure. We can only approximate what the total value might be for all leaseholds and freeholds in the database. Given that the average price of these freeholds and leasholds is £1,512,032 we might expect the total figure to be around the £150 billion mark. This is substantially higher than the esimate given by the Financial Times in 2015 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6cb11114-18aa-11e4-a51a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz46ls5rtpE&quot;&gt;£122 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cxBIK/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-about-secrecy-and-tax&quot;&gt;It’s about secrecy and tax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the top 10 countries through which these properties are owned. These are the archetypal tax havens and secrecy jursidictions. Half of them rank in the top 20 most secretive jurisdictions in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results&quot;&gt;Tax Justice Network’s Financial Secrecy Index&lt;/a&gt;. This quite clearly is not about foreign nationals and normal overseas companies owning property in England and Wales, but rather the deliberate choice to use jurisidctions renowned for low tax rates and corproate secrecy to buy and sell property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JNsPc/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;343&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-vast-majority-of-overseas-ownership-is-in-greater-london&quot;&gt;The vast majority of overseas ownership is in Greater London&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, overseas ownership of property and land is concentrated in the South East and Greater London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AFgqt/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;433&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discredited-companies-use-overseas-ownership-extensively&quot;&gt;Discredited companies use overseas ownership extensively&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look at the top 5 companies that make most extensive use of offshore purchasing of land, we see that one of them, Profitable Plots, has been caught up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/news/7436428/Green-Belt-housing-scheme-promoted-by-footballers-leaves-investors-in-the-red.html&quot;&gt;a scandal that involved cheating investors for just short of a million dollars&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly not all people who use offshore property ownership are out to scam, but the level of secrecy afforded to companies incorporated in places like the British Virgin Islands is an invitation to all sorts of nefarious activity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Something is rotten in the state of Denmark</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;aligned intro&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Originally posted at on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalwitness.org/en/blog/something-rotten-state-denmark/&quot;&gt;Global Witness blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A compelling new Danish drama does a stellar job at portraying some of the mechanisms of corruption that we at Global Witness are all too familiar with.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aligned&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re big fans of the new Danish TV series &lt;i&gt;Follow the Money&lt;/i&gt;. It’s a great piece of drama, but we’re also fascinated because it’s a case of fiction mirroring reality right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone following our work, the script used in &lt;i&gt;Follow the Money&lt;/i&gt; will be familiar. A small set of wealthy individuals use the secrecy afforded by offshore jurisdictions to hide and channel illicit funds at the expense of everyday people and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://globalwitness.org/media/images/Energreen.width-300.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aligned&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tells another important story, which often gets lost. Corruption isn’t something that just affects fragile states and dictatorships, it’s far closer to home than many Western governments like to admit. As our work has shown time and time again, Western companies, law firms and banks are key enablers for moving dirty cash around the world and covering up secret deals, and their governments could be doing much more to put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact Denmark seems like the perfect setting to make this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number one in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015&quot;&gt;Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, Denmark does not suffer from the kind of grand corruption that plagues those at the bottom of the Index like Cambodia or Afghanistan. However, such is the structure of the global financial system today, Danish companies and citizens, like those in any other European country, can use networks of offshore subsidiaries to hide and launder illicit funds whilst retaining the veneer of corporate respectability that being based in a center of global finance affords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services offered in places like the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands can be used to hide wealth from tax authorities, deceive law enforcement agencies and introduce huge levels of risk to unwitting investors. We’ve seen some these mechanisms at play in our recent investigations into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/mystery-baker-street/&quot;&gt;London property market&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/oil-gas-and-mining/shell-and-enis-misadventures-nigeria/&quot;&gt;acquisition of one of West Africa’s largest oil blocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fictional, cut-throat energy firm at the heart of the plot, Energreen, uses a number of these ploys to devastating effect. Below are three of the top ways in which its activities mirror the companies we often investigate:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-exposing-anonymous-companies-could-cut-down-on-crime-global-witness&quot;&gt;Anonymous shell companies&lt;/a&gt; are the currency of the corrupt&lt;/b&gt; - Energreen and its insider traders use a network of subsidiaries whose true owners are hidden in order to siphon off funds and fraudulently pump up the value of its own assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secrecy jurisdictions and tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands are conduits for illicit financial flows&lt;/b&gt; - The network of subsidiaries used by Energreen are often based in offshore secrecy jurisdictions deliberately obscuring critical information about the company from law enforcement, the public and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corruption affects us all&lt;/b&gt; - Energreen’s eventual collapse after it goes public leaves a huge range of investors exposed including pension funds used by everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/david-cameron-majority-british-public-want-you-act-tax-havens/&quot;&gt;two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; this is a problem that the UK can help to fix by taking action on the UK Territories. For our readers based in the UK, you can watch all 10 episodes of &lt;i&gt;Follow the Money&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072h7rk&quot;&gt;BBC iPlayer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

        <title>Is the NHS safe in Cameron's hands?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the government’s increasingly bitter dispute with Junior Doctors rolls on to the backdrop of a critically overstretched health service, it’s difficult to see how David Cameron can back up his words during the 2015 election campaign that NHS is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itv.com/news/update/2015-05-18/david-cameron-the-nhs-is-safe-in-my-hands/&quot;&gt;“safe in my hands”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data published by NHS England appears to show A&amp;amp;E waiting times slipping to new lows as patients in need of emergency care wait longer to be admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the hallmarks of the the New Labour years was a focus on performance targets in public service particualry the NHS. This drew criticism from Conservatives and accusations of public sector bodies gaming the system. It’s interesting to observe that when it comes to A&amp;amp;E waiting times, a loosening of targets has coincided with a steep drop in the number of patients waiting less than 4 hours in A&amp;amp;E.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition government on taking the reigns in 2010 reduced the target for the proportion of A&amp;amp;E attendees being seen in under 4 hours from 98% to 95%. Despite the lower bar, the NHS under the Conservatives appears unable to achieve this as demonstrated by the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ivf9S/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;748&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a similar story when it comes to the number of patients waiting 12 hours or more from decision to admit to admission.  Although still relatively small, the numbers have been steadily rising since 2010, with an unexplained spike in December 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://charts.datawrapper.de/6OOHu/index.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;748&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In poking around the public data available on NHS performance, I found a worrying lack of consistency in the reporting between administrations. On top of this, the A&amp;amp;E waiting list data pre-2010 appears not to have been properly archived and as such is no longer available to the public. These historical data gaps make it harder to compare the performance of subsequent governments and truly assess key election pledges around the protection of essential public services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the data that is available and in-depth studies of it by &lt;a href=&quot;http://qmr.kingsfund.org.uk/2016/18/&quot;&gt;groups like the King’s Fund&lt;/a&gt; [2] paint a damning picture that put the lie to Cameron’s “safe in my hands” line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Have targets improved NHS performance? - The King’s Fund &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/general-election-2010/key-election-questions/performance-targets&quot;&gt;http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/general-election-2010/key-election-questions/performance-targets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
